This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification.

THIS IS A WARNING MESSAGE ONLY.

YOU DO *NOT* NEED TO RESEND YOUR MESSAGE.

Delivery to the following recipients has been delayed.

       %(rcpt)s

Subject: %(subject)s
Received-SPF: %(spf_result)s

Your sender policy (or lack thereof) indicated that the above email was not
sent via an authorized SMTP server, but may still be legitimate.  Since there
is no positive confirmation that the message is really from you, we have
to give it extra scrutiny - including verifying that the sender really
exists by sending you this DSN.  We will remember this sender and not
bother you again for a while.  You can avoid this message entirely for
legitimate mail by using an authorized SMTP server.  Contact your mail
administrator and ask how to configure your email client to use an
authorized server.

If you never sent the above message, then your domain has been forged.
Your mail admin needs to publish a strict SPF record so that I can reject
those forgeries instead of bugging you about them.  

See http://openspf.org for details.

If you need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

postmaster@%(receiver)s
