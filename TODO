Defer TEMPERROR in SPF evaluation - give precedence to security
(only defer for PASS mechanisms).

Option to add Received-SPF header, but never reject on SPF.

Create null config that does nothing - except maybe add Received-SPF
headers.  Many admins would like to turn features on one at a time.

Auto whitelist based on outgoing email - perhaps with magic subject
or recipient prefix.

Can't output messages with malformed rfc822 attachments.

Example malformed SPF:
onvunvuvvx.usafisnews.org text "v=spf1 mx ptr ip4:207.44.199.970 -all"

Move milter,Milter,mime,spf modules to pymilter
milter package will have bms.py application

Support SMTP AUTH and disable SPF checks when connection is authorized.
Web admin interface
Check valid domains allowed by internal senders to detect PCs infected
with spam trojans.
Do CBV (callback verification) for mail with no published SPF record.
message log for automated stats and blacklisting
Skip dspam when SPF pass?
Report 551 with rcpt on SPF fail?
check spam keywords with character classes, e.g.
	{a}=[a@гд], {i}=[i1н], {e}=[eл], {o}=[o0ц]

Implement RRS - a backdoor for non-SRS forwarders.  User lists non-SRS 
forwarder accounts, and a util provides a special local alias for the
user to give to the forwarder.  Alias only works for mail from that
forwarder.  Milter gets forwarder domain from alias and uses it to
SPF check forwarder.

Another special dspam user, 'honeypot', can be listed in innoculations.
All email to those addresses is treated as known spam.

Framework for modular Python milter components within a single VM.
Python milters can be already be composed through sendmail by running each in
a separate process.  However, a significant amount of memory is wasted
for each additional Python VM, and communication between milters
is cumbersome (e.g., adding mail headers, writing external files).

Backup copies for outgoing/incoming mail.

Allow multiple wiretap groups, each with its own destination.  Perhaps 
also copy incoming wiretap mail, even though sendmail alias works perfectly
for the purpose, to avoid having to change two configs for a wiretap.

Provide a way to reload milter.cfg without stopping/restarting milter.

Allow selected Windows extensions for specific domains via milter.cfg

Fix setup.py so that _FFR_QUARANTINE is automatically defined when
available in libmilter.

Keep separate ismodified flag for headers and body.  This is important
when rejecting outgoing mail with viruses removed (so as not to
embarrass yourself), and also removing Received headers with hidepath.

Wrap smfi_setbacklog(int) - but it is only available in sendmail >= 8.12.3,
  so how can we detect whether to wrap it?

Need a test module to feed sample messages to a milter though a live 
sendmail and SMTP.  The mockup currently used is probably not very accurate,
and doesn't test the threading code.
