Hello. I am a mail screener working for Business Management Systems in
Fairfax, VA. There is a problem with the domain:
<blockquote>
     %domain
</blockquote>

While this domain is properly configured for email, it has acquired quite
a reputation for spam on emails where the authentication result
is %qual.  On a scale of -100 to 100, it scores %score.
<p>
If you are just an innocent user trying to send mail, then your mail server
could be compromised.  You can give us a call at
703-591-0911 and my boss can reset your domain reputation.
