<h2> SPF FAIL for HELO domain </h2>

Hello. I work for Business Management Systems in Fairfax, VA. There was a 
problem with your HELO name:
<blockquote>
     %helo
</blockquote>
The owners of the %helo domain have published a Sender Policy
(<a href="http://openspf.org">rfc4408</a>),
and the HELO name, <code>%helo</code>, is NOT AUTHORIZED for the MTA sending
from <code>%ip</code>.   There is no authorization for the MAIL FROM 
(%mfrom) either.  Consequently, we have honored the request of
the owners of the %helo domain, and rejected your email.  If
you think your email is legitimate, please talk to them,
or talk to your mail administrator (who may have incorrectly
configured your mail server).
