Hello. I am a mail screener working for Business Management Systems in
Fairfax, VA. There is a problem with the domain:
<blockquote>
     %domain
</blockquote>
We have banned this domain for email abuse.  The specific reasons were
given on your domains previous attempts to send us email.  I don't currently
track this history automatically - sorry.
<p>
If you are just an innocent user trying to send mail, then your mail server
could be compromised or misconfigured.  You can give us a call at
703-591-0911 and my boss can look in my logs to see what happened, and
might unban your domain.
