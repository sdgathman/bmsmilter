Hello. I work for Business Management Systems in Fairfax, VA. There is a 
problem with:
<blockquote>
     %mfrom
</blockquote>
The HELO name, <code>%helo</code>, is invalid (does not resolve to
<code>%ip</code>).  There is no valid PTR record for <code>%ip</code> (does
not exist or does not resolve to <code>%ip</code>.  Dynamic
names for HELO or PTR do not count since you have no <a
href="http://openspf.net">Sender Policy</a> either.
<p>
Contact your mail administrator IMMEDIATELY!  Your mail server is
severely misconfigured.  (If you have a dynamic PTR/HELO, it is technically
correct, but most email services reject dynamic PTR because it generally
indicates a "bot", a compromised home PC that sends spam.)
