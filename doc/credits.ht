<h1> CREDITS </h1>

<a href="mailto:Jim Niemira <urmane@urmane.org>">Jim Niemira</a>
wrote the original C module and some quick
and dirty python to use it.  
<a href="http://gathman.org/vitae">Stuart D. Gathman</a>
took that kludge and added threading and context objects to it, wrote a proper
OO wrapper (Milter.py) that handles attachments, did lots of testing, packaged
it with distutils, and generally transformed it from a quick hack to a
real, usable Python extension.
