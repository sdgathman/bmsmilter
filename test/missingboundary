Cleo - please review attached feedback from Sales team.......I recall at 
an early meeting after we moved in you and Tony (and maybe 1 or 2 
others) were going to develop a voice mail procedure or instruction 
sheet for all staff. It looks like we really need this to get what we 
are looking for from the system. Please let me know when you can produce 
this and give a draft to the managers here for review.
Thanks,
Lee

Rich:

Following is a summary of concerns from customers regarding internal
communications within WS:

	- Not all employees have activated their voice mail - when this is the
case, the system will automatically cut you off
	- When employees are out of the office, phones are not forwarded to a back
up, ie manager
	- Reception has no record of employee attendance, and therefore will
forward call to individual requested - see point 2
 	- Reception directs calls to incorrect individuals
 	- When entering voice mail, if you press '0', system does not default to
operator, but puts you back into individual 	voice mail
	- Reception phone demeanor has no 'pep'

Thanks
Joe
